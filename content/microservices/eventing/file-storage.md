You can trigger webhooks on any file storage operations (create/delete) performed via Space Cloud.

## Create file storage event trigger

Open a project in Mission Control, head to the `Event Triggers` section and click on the `Add` button to open the form below:

![File storage event trigger](/images/screenshots/file-trigger.png)

### Parameters

**Trigger Name**

Give a unique name for an event trigger. (e.g., `upload-profile-pic` )

**Source**

Select `File Storage` as the event source.

**Trigger operation**

Select the file storage operation for which you want to create the event trigger. Can be one of:

- **Write:** When a file/folder gets written/created.
- **Delete:** When a file/folder gets deleted.

**Webhook URL**

The HTTP(s) URL that should get triggered with the event payload on the configured operation. Must be a `POST` handler.

### Advanced settings

**Retries** 

The number of times to retry a failed invocation. Default value is 3.

**Timeout**

Timeout in milliseconds. Default value is 5000.

## Delivery mechanism

The webhook is delivered over `HTTP POST` request to the specified webhook URL with the following headers:

{{< highlight http >}}
Content-Type: application/json
{{< /highlight >}}  

## Event payload

The `POST` body of the webhook is a JSON object which follows the [Cloud Events specs](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec):

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "specversion": "1.0-rc1",
  "id": "<unique-uuid>",
  "type": "<event-type>",
  "source": "<space-cloud-node-id>",
  "time": "<date-string>",
  "data": {
    "path": "<file-path>",
    "meta": "Object"
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}  


| Key         | Type   |                                                                                  Description |
|:------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| specversion | String |                                                  Version of the Cloud Events specifications. |
| id          | String |                                                             A unique identifier of an event. |
| type        | String |                                          Event type. One of `FILE_CREATE` or `FILE_DELETE` . |
| source      | String |                                                 Unique identifier of a Space Cloud instance. |
| time        | String |                                           Time at which the event occurred(ISO 8601 format). |
| data.path   | String |                                                           Path of the concerned file/folder. |
| data.meta   | String |                               `meta` object sent by the client while creating/deleting file. |

**For example:**

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "specversion" : "1.0-rc1",
  "id": "43e32d79-f2bf-41c0-be5f-a75c8c1bcfbf",
  "type": "DB_INSERT",
  "source": "1fb07d5d-b670-468e-ba94-ad5f06a5c053",
  "time": "2019-10-19T12:40:50.053Z",
  "data": {
    "path": "/users/1/profile.jpg",
    "meta": {
      "file_size": 100,
      "upload_date": "2019-10-19T12:40:50.053Z"
    }
  }
}

> **Note:** The `meta` object is not generated by Space Cloud. It is an optional field sent by the client as a stringified JSON in the formdata at `meta` key while creating/deleting a file/folder.  

## Webhook response structure
A `2xx` response status code from the webhook target is deemed to be a successful invocation of the webhook. Any other response status results in an unsuccessful invocation that causes retries as per the retry configuration.

<!-- ### Retry-After header
If the webhook response contains a `Retry-After` header, then the event gets redelivered once more after the duration (in seconds) found in the header. Note that the header is respected if the response status code is `429` (Too many requests).

The `Retry-After` header is useful for retrying/rate-limiting/debouncing your webhook triggers. -->
