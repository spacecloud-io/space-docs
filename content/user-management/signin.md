You can easily allow users to log in to your app via email using the `db.signIn` function. This is how you could add a simple log in feature in your app. Make sure you have enabled the `auth` module. Here's a code snippet to implement basic email sign in:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
import { API } from 'space-api';

// Initialize api with the project name and url of the space cloud
const api = new API('todo_app', 'http://localhost:4122');

// Initialize database(s) you intend to use
const db = api.DB("mydb");

// SignIn
db.signIn('demo@example.com', '1234').then(res => {
  if (res.status === 200) {
    // Set the token id to enable operations of other modules
    api.setToken(res.data.token)
    
    // res.data contains request payload
    console.log('Response:', res.data);
    return;
  }
  // Request failed
}).catch(ex => {
  // Exception occured while processing request
});
{{< /highlight >}}  

As you would have noticed, the above function is asynchronous in nature. The `signIn` method takes 2 parameters:

- **email** - Email of the user.
- **pass** - Password of the user.

## Response

On getting the log in request, Space Cloud validates whether such an user exists and sends a response accordingly. A response object sent by the server contains the **status** and **data** fields explained below.

**status:** Number describing the http status code of the response. Following values are possible:

- 200 - Successful sign in
- 404 - No user with the given email
- 401 - The given credentials are not correct
- 500 - Internal server error

**data:** The data object consists of the following fields:

- **token** - The JWT token generated by the authentication module. The token contains the following claims - **id** (the unique id for the user), **role** and **email**
- **user** - Row / document corresponding to the signed in user

## Next steps

The next step would be checking out the client reference to register a new user.
