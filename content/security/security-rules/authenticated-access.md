Space Cloud supports JWT based authentication. 

## How does authentication work?

As you can see, authentication is performed outside of Space Cloud. However, it validates whether a request is authenticated and enforces your authorization/access-control logic. 

Space Cloud expects a JWT token in every incoming request. For HTTP requests, the token should be present inside `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`, whereas for websocket requests, the token should be present in the `data.token` key of the message body.

The security module in Space Cloud checks whether a token is valid or not based on the following criteria:

- The token should get verified by anyone of the `secrets` provided to Space Cloud. Check out the docs for [configuring JWT secrets](/security/jwt-based-authentication/configuring-jwt-secrets) to learn more about providing secrets to Space Cloud.
- If the token contains an expiry (seconds since epoch in the `exp` claim), then its value should be in the future.

Space Cloud considers a request to be authenticated, only if it contains a valid token. Once a token is considered valid, its claims are parsed and made available in the `args.auth` variable to be used by security rules.

If a user tries to change any of the token claims or tries to create his/her false token, it would fail at the verification stage because of the nature of JWTs. You can check out the [official website](https://jwt.io) of the JWT project to learn more about it.

### Where to get tokens from?

Usually, a token is generated and provided by an authentication service on a successful signin/signup request by a user. These tokens are signed with a `secret` by the authentication service. This `secret` needs to be provided to Space Cloud for token-based authentication to work. 

You can either use the [in-built user management module](/user-management) of Space Cloud as an authentication service or use a custom / third-party service like Firebase Auth, Auth0, etc.

## Enforcing authentication

Authentication is enforced by all security rules except `allow` rule. However, if you want to enforce authentication only for a particular resource, you should use the `authenticated` rule like this:

{
  "rule": "authenticated"
}
{{< /highlight >}}
