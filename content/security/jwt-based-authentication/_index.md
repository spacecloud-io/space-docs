Space Cloud supports JWT based authentication. 

## How does authentication work?

As you can see, authentication is handled outside of Space Cloud. 

However, Space Cloud is responsible for validating whether a user is authenticated or not. It also helps you enforce your access control logic along with any data masking steps if needed. Check out the [security rules](/security/security-rules) to learn more about the possibilities of access control.

Space Cloud considers a request to be authenticated, only if it contains a valid JWT token. Check out the [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) project if you are new to JWTs.

Space Cloud will consider a token to be valid based on the following criteria:

- The token should get verified by anyone of the `secrets` provided to Space Cloud. Checking out the docs for [adding-jwt-secrets](/security/jwt-based-authentication/configuring-jwt-secrets) to learn more about providing secrets to Space Cloud.
- If the token contains an expiry (seconds since epoch in the `exp` claim), then its value should be greater than the current time (in seconds since epoch).

Once a token is considered valid, its claims are parsed and made available in the `args.auth` variable to be used by security rules.

If a user tries to change any of the token claims or tries to create his/her false token, it would fail at the verification stage because of the nature of JWTs. You can check out the [official website](https://jwt.io) of the JWT project to learn more about it.

## Providing JWT tokens in a request

For HTTP requests, the token should be present inside `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`, whereas for websocket requests, the token should be present in the `data.token` key of the message body.

Here's how a sample token looks like:

{{< highlight bash >}}
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.drt_po6bHhDOF_FJEHTrK-KD8OGjseJZpHwHIgsnoTM
{{< /highlight >}}


Usually, these tokens should be provided by your authentication service on a successful signin/signup. Space Cloud can verify these tokens as long as it is configured with the secret used by your authentication service for signing these tokens.

Check out the docs for [configuring JWT secrets](/security/jwt-based-authentication/configuring-jwt-secrets) to learn more about the different types of secrets supported and the additional security checks.

Space Cloud integrates out of the box with most popular third-party auth services like Firebase Auth, Auth0, etc. Check out the docs for [integrating third-party auth services](/security/jwt-based-authentication/third-party-auth) to learn more about it.

## Enforcing authentication

Authentication is enforced by all security rules except `allow` rule. However, if you want to only enforce authentication for a particular resource, you should use the `authenticated` rule like this:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
{
  "rule": "authenticated"
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Check out the docs for [security rules](/security/security-rules) to learn more about the different types of security rules that you can use to enforce your access control logic.
