Space Cloud is an **open-source, kubernetes based platform which lets you build, scale and secure cloud native apps at scale**. 

It provides instant **GraphQL** and **REST** APIs for your database and microservices that can be consumed directly from your frontend in a secure manner. With that, it also deploys and scales your docker images on Kubernetes.
