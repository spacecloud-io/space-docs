This guide helps you model a Pokemon app ðŸ˜› to explore the data modelling in Space Cloud!

> **Note:** This guide assumes PostgreSQL as the database, but you can use whichever you like.

## Setup

If you want to follow this guide along practically, first [deploy Space Cloud](https://learn.spaceuptech.com/space-cloud/basics/setup/) along with PostgreSQL and create a project in Mission Control with PostgreSQL as the primary database.

Then head over to the `Overview` tab in the `Database` section.

Time for some data modelling now!

## Modelling the data

The Pokemon app which we are going to build have trainers and pokemons (quite obviousðŸ˜…). 

Each pokemon belongs to a single trainer, and each trainer can have multiple pokemonsðŸ˜‹. Note that this a **one-to-many relationship**. Read more about modelling relations [here](/storage/database/data-modelling/relations).

### Trainer table

We want each trainer to have a unique id, name and city field. 

Click the `Add table` button in the Database Overview page in Mission Control to open the following form:

![Add table screen](/images/screenshots/add-table.png)

Name your table as `trainer`.

Copy-paste the following schema and hit `Save`:

{{< highlight graphql >}}
type trainer {
  id: ID! @primary
  name: String!
  city: String
  pokemons: [pokemon] @link(table: "pokemon", from: "id", to: "trainer_id")
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Space Cloud creates a `trainer` table with the above schema. The exclamation mark `!` for `id` and `name` indicates that these fields are required (i.e. they can't be null).

> **Note:** The `pokemons` field is not a physical field in the `trainer` table. It's just a virtual field that links to the `pokemon` table to make GraphQL queries and mutations simpler from the frontend. We are going to cover it in more details below.


### Pokemon table

Let's say a trainer wants to record the name and combat power of each pokemon along with the date when he captured it. 

Once again click on the `Add table` button to add the `pokemon` table with the following schema:

{{< highlight graphql >}}
type pokemon {
  id: ID! @primary
  name: String!
  combat_power: Integer
  caught_on: DateTime! @createdAt
  trainer_id: ID! @foreign(table: "trainer", field: "id")
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The `@foreign` directive above instructs Space Cloud to create a foreign key on the `id` field of the `trainer` table.  This foreign key prevents any actions that would destroy the links between the `pokemon` and `trainer` table. Which means that the database would throw an error if you delete a trainer before deleting their pokemons.

> **You can modify the foreign key behaviour to delete the child record(s) automatically when parent record is deleted instead of throwing error. This can be done by specifying the `onDelete` argument of the `foreign` directive as follows:**

{{< highlight graphql "hl_lines=6" >}}
type pokemon {
  id: ID! @primary
  name: String!
  combat_power: Integer
  caught_on: DateTime! @createdAt
  trainer_id: ID! @foreign(table: "trainer", field: "id", onDelete: "cascade")
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The `@createdAt` directive helps Space Cloud to automatically insert the datetime value whenever you insert a pokemon into the `pokemon` table.

## Time to play around

Let's insert some data and see whether Space Cloud is validating our data and maintaining its integrity or not.

Head over to the `Explorer` section in Mission Control:

![Explorer](/images/screenshots/explorer.png)

### Inserting trainers along with their pokemons 

Try running the following graphql queries to insert some trainers and pokemons:

{{< highlight graphql >}}
mutation {
  insert_trainer(
    docs: [
      {
        id: "ash", 
        name: "Ash", 
        city: "Pallete Town",
        pokemons: [
          {
            id: "1",
            name: "Pikachu",
            combat_power: 200
          },
          {
            id: "2",
            name: "Charmender",
            combat_power: 150
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        id: "misty", 
        name: "Misty", 
        city: "Cerulean City",
        pokemons: [
          {
            id: "3",
            name: "Psyduck",
            combat_power: 180
          },
          {
            id: "4",
            name: "Goldeen",
            combat_power: 150
          }
        ]        
      }
    ]
  ) @postgres {
    status
    error
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

You would see a response like this:

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "insert_trainer": {
    "status": 200
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This means we have successfully inserted trainers along with their pokemons.

Space Cloud inserts the trainers info in the `trainer` table while the nested `pokemons` info in the `pokemon` table.

If you remember, we mentioned a `@link` directive on the `pokemons` field in the `trainer` table along with the argument - `table: "pokemon"`. Space Cloud uses this information to insert the pokemons array correctly into the `pokemon` table. It also inserts the `pokemon.trainer_id` field automatically based on the foreign key that we mentioned.

### Query trainers along with their pokemons

Try running the following graphql query in the GraphiQL section:

{{< highlight graphql >}}
query {
  trainer @postgres {
    id
    name
    city
    pokemons {
      name
      combat_power
      caught_on
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}


You should be able to see a response which looks like this:

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "trainer": [
    {
      "id": "ash",
      "name": "Ash",
      "city": "Pallete Town",
      "pokemons": [
        {
          "name": "Pikachu",
          "combat_power": 200,
          "caught_on": "2019-10-15T07:21:14.643874Z"
        },
        {
          "name": "Charmender",
          "combat_power": 150,
          "caught_on": "2019-10-15T07:21:14.643876Z"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "misty",
      "name": "Misty",
      "city": "Cerulean City",
      "pokemons": [
        {
          "name": "Psyduck",
          "combat_power": 180,
          "caught_on": "2019-10-15T07:21:14.643877Z"
        },
        {
          "name": "Goldeen",
          "combat_power": 150,
          "caught_on": "2019-10-15T07:21:14.643877Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The query that we used above performs a join operation on the backend between `trainer` and `pokemon` table with the condition - `trainer.id == pokemon.trainer_id`. This condition is derived by the arguments (`table`, `from`, `to`) of the `@link` directive, which we mentioned earlier. You can read more about `@link` directive from [here](/storage/database/data-modelling/supported-features/#link-directive).

Notice that we even received the values for `caught_on` even though we did not specify it while inserting. It means that Space Cloud auto-generated the values for `caught_on` field for us! Pretty great right?

It's time to put on the devil's hat and tinker around Space Cloud's data validation plane!

### Validate data

Let's check whether Space Cloud is enforcing the constraints or not that we specified (Foreign keys and required fields in our case).

Try running the following query in the GraphiQL section:

{{< highlight graphql >}}
mutation {
  insert_trainer(
    docs: [
      {id: "brock", city: "Pallete Town"},
    ]
  ) @postgres {
    status
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This query should return the following error - `Field name Not Present`.


**Let's check whether the field type validations are working or not.** Try running the following query in the GraphiQL section:

{{< highlight graphql >}}
mutation {
  insert_trainer(
    docs: [
      {id: "brock", name: 123, city: "Pallete Town"},
    ]
  ) @postgres {
    status
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This query should return the following error - `Integer wrong type wanted String got Integer`.

> **Note:** This validation layer works even for schemaless databases! 

This **robust validation layer** ensures that no one can mess around with your data structure! ðŸ˜Ž

**Now let's check whether the foreign keys are working or not:**

{{< highlight graphql >}}
mutation {
  delete_trainer(
    where: {id: "ash"}
  ) @postgres {
    status
    error
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This mutation should fail with the following response:

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "delete_trainer": {
    "error": "pq: update or delete on table \"trainer\" violates foreign key constraint \"c_pokemon_trainer_id\" on table \"pokemon\"",
    "status": 500
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

It means Space Cloud has created foreign keys for us which helped us maintain the integrity of the relation.

Great! You have just learned the basics of data modelling in Space Cloud. The next steps would be to take a deep dive into all the [features of data modelling](/storage/database/data-modelling/supported-features) or learn [modelling relations](/storage/database/data-modelling/relations) in detail.
