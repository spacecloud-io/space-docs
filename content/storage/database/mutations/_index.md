Mutations are used to modify data on the server (i.e. write, update or delete data).

Space Cloud parses the mutation request (GraphQL or JSON) and executes native database queries as per the request. The following types of mutation requests are possible:

- [Insert](/storage/database/mutations/insert)
- [Update](/storage/database/mutations/update)
- [Upsert](/storage/database/mutations/upsert)
- [Delete](/storage/database/mutations/delete)
- [Transactions](/storage/database/mutations/transactions)
