You can easily configure access control for the database APIs with Space Cloud's security rules. The security rules in the database module work on the operation level (create, read, update, delete) for each table/collection. This means that you can have different rules for different operations on each table/collection.

Here's a sample snippet which shows the rules on the `users` table. Operations `create`  and `read` are allowed while `update` and `delete` are blocked:

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "create": {
    "rule": "allow"
  },
  "read": {
    "rule": "allow"
  },
  "update": {
    "rule": "deny"
  },
  "delete": {
    "rule": "deny"
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Space Cloud's security rules are flexible enough to enforce any access control logic including querying your databases, validating conditions and masking private data. Check out the documentation of [security rules](/security/security-rules) to learn more.

## Configuring security rules

Head over to the `Overview` tab in the `Database` section of the Mission Control. 

![Tracked Tables](/images/screenshots/tracked-tables.png)

Click on the `Secure` action on any of the tracked tables/collections.

This will open a Rule Builder UI to configure the rules easily:

The rule editor also comes packed with few [shortcuts](/security/security-rules/configuring-rules#shortcuts) to make you feel productive.

If you are more comfortable with JSON, you can switch to the JSON editor as well by clicking on the `JSON` tab. 

The API Explorer of Mission Control comes packed with a token builder as well to make [testing your security rules](/security/security-rules/configuring-rules/#testing-security-rules) for different JWT claims a breeze!

## Available variables

Following are the variables available in the security rules for different operations in the database module:
