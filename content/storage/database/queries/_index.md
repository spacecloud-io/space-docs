Queries are used to fetch data from the database via Space Cloud. 

Space Cloud can query data from any database (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server). It even allows you to perform **cross-database joins**.

The following topics will be covered in this section:

- Making [simple queries](/storage/database/queries/simple-queries)
- Performing [join](/storage/database/queries/joins) operations
- Performing [aggregations](/storage/database/queries/aggregations) on your data
- [Filtering](/storage/database/queries/filtering)
- [Sorting](/storage/database/queries/sorting)
- [Pagination](/storage/database/queries/pagination)
- [Multiple operations](/storage/database/queries/multiple-operations)
- [Multiple queries](/storage/database/queries/multiple-queries)
