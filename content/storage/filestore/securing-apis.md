The security rules for file storage access works to authorize client requests for file store operations. Authorization works on the operation level (read, create and delete) for each path prefix. This means that you can have different rules for different path prefixes. 

Here's a sample snippet which shows the rules on the `/images/:userId` prefix. Operations `create`  and `read` are allowed while `delete` is blocked.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "prefix": "/images/:userId",
  "rule": {
    "create": {
      "rule": "allow"
    },
    "read": {
      "rule": "allow"
    },
   "delete": {
      "rule": "deny"
    }
  }
}

Space Cloud's security rules are flexible enough to enforce any access control logic including querying your databases, validating conditions and masking private data. Check out the documentation of [security rules](/security/security-rules/) to learn more.

## Points to note

The following points need to be kept in mind for the security rules in the file storage module:

- All rules are applied to a prefix. A prefix is nothing but the path prefix where the file/folder is present or is to be created.
- The prefix may contain path parameters (e.g. `/:userId` in the above example). The value of the path parameter is available in the `args.params` object. For the above example, `userId` field would be available in the `args.params` object with the value being the actual value provided in the path for that `userId` path parameter.

## Configuring security rules

Head over to the `File Storage` section of the Mission Control. Click on the `Add` button to add a security rule:

![Add FileStore Rule](/images/screenshots/add-filestore-rule.png)

Enter the path prefix for which you want to enter a rule. As discussed above, the prefix can contain path parameters. The default security rules would be prefilled for you. You can change it now or even later with the Rule Builder or the JSON editor.

Give the rule a name. This name is for you to identify the rule later.

To modify a rule, click the `Edit` button from the `Actions` table:
