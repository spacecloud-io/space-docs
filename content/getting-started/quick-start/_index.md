This guide helps you try Space Cloud quickly with Postgres and GraphQL without having to set up any frontend project. It's the easiest way to explore the powers of Space Cloud.

> **Note:** If you want to start a project with Space Cloud from scratch, then the [deployment guide](/getting-started/deployment) would be a better resource.

## Choose a quick start guide:
- [Using Docker Compose](/getting-started/quick-start/docker-compose) **(recommended)**: Run a local development setup that sets up both the Space Cloud and MongoDB.
- [Using the binary](/getting-started/quick-start/manual): Manually deploy `space-cloud` on your machine.
- Using Heroku: Coming soon!
