This section talks in-depth about deploying Space Cloud in production. 

If you would like to take Space Cloud for a quick spin, refer to our [Space Cloud Basics Guide](https://learn.spaceuptech.com/space-cloud/basics/setup/).

> **Note:** Make sure that any database that you want to integrate with Space Cloud is up and running.

The recommended way to get started with Space Cloud is by [installing it on Kubernetes](/install/kubernetes).

> If you just want to use the `Gateway` component of Space Cloud directly, you can [follow this guide](/install/using-gateway-directly) instead.
