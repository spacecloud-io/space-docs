Sometimes it is important to configure certain parameters like Space Cloud's default admin username and password. Space Cloud lets you do that by providing a yaml file while running `space-cli setup`.

## Default Configuration

Space Cloud is started by sensible defaults which works out of the box for most use cases. The following configuration is used when no files are provided.

```yaml
# Default values for space-cloud.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

clusterId: "default"
devMode: "true" # Turn this to false for production mode
isKedaEnabled: true # Set this to false to skip installing keda

admin:
  username: "admin" # Log in username
  password: "1234" # Log in password
  secret: "some-secret" # Space cloud uses this secret for parsing jwt tokens for config APIs

meta:
  logLevel: "debug" # other values info, warn
  logFormat: "json" # other values text

# Gateway service configuration
gateway:
  healthCheck:
    initialDelaySeconds: 100 # tells the kubelet that it should wait 100 seconds before performing the first health check.
    periodSeconds: 10 # field specifies that the kubelet should perform a liveness probe every 10 seconds.
    timeout: 5 # http request timeout, it should be less than (periodSeconds)

      cpu: "500m"
  ssl:
    enabled: "true"
    custom_ssl_secret: "" # If required change this to the Kubernetes secret name containing custom SSL cert
    custom_ssl_cert_key: "" # Secret key containing SSL public certificate
    custom_ssl_private_key: "" # Secret key containing SSL private key

# Connection string used by gateway & runner to connect to other services
connections:
  redisConn: "redis.space-cloud.svc.cluster.local:6379" 
  prometheusConn: "http://prometheus.space-cloud.svc.cluster.local:9090" 
```

## Overriding Default Configuration

To override the default configurations:
- Download the [default yaml config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud/master/install-manifests/helm/space-cloud/values.yaml) and store it as a yaml file (Eg. `sc-config.yaml`).
- Make necessary changes in the file directly.
- Run the following command to install Space Cloud with the provided config:

```bash
space-cli setup -f sc-config.yaml
```

## Changing Configuration After Installation

It is possible to change Space Cloud configuration after installation as well.

Simply make a `sc-config.yaml` file with the updated config and run the following command:

```bash
space-cli update -f sc-config.yaml
```
